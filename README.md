first time use of the application the user will have to use the Register button and proceed to the registration form and enter a username,password,name and surname and create the profile which will be stored in the database.

The user is required to fill all text fields with information as any blanks will result in a notification telling the user to fill in all spaces, if the user uses a username that already exists in the database they will be told so and be told to choose a different one.

After this is completed the user is free to login using the newly created username and password.
